                    <h4>CubeSat (Nano-Satellite) Development</h4>
                    <p>As my final year project, and as the only mechanical engineer on the team, I was tasked with designing a thermally and 
                        dimensionally constrained  (16x10x10cm) pressure vessel. The CubeSat, being a multi-year development through the University of 
                        Canterbury, will eventually be launched in to space.</p>

                    <h4>Patient Lifter for C7 Tetraplegia</h4>
                    <p>The aim of this design project was to design a patient lifter/transfer device for users with C7 tetraplegia. 
                        With help from Cody Everson on the NZ Wheel Blacks, an autonomous transfer device was designed to suit the needs of 
                        Cody and others with C7 tetraplegia.</p>

                    <h4>High Ropes Course</h4>
                    <p>As a final exam with a time budget of 24 hours, the high ropes course was designed to be suitable for people of all 
                        ranges of mobilities. The course incorporates a route for a wheelchair user as well as a fully mobile user.</p>

                    <h4>5kW Wind Turbine Gearbox</h4>
                    <p>The gearbox design project was part of a team design of a 5 kW wind turbine. My aim was to create a gearbox which 
                        stepped up the speed 6:1. An epicyclic gearbox best completed the design.</p>

                    <h4>Summer Research Project</h4>
                    <p>A patient lifter, something seemingly so simple yet so complex. As the receiver of the summer research scholarship, 
                        I was given the chance to work with HT Systems to help develop a new prototype.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this project was to create a large pressure vessel subject to BS 5169:1992 that would complete the 
                        task.</p>

                    <h4>The World Clock</h4>
                    <p>The brief for this project was simple, using Solidworks, create a mechatronic or mechanical clock that shows the time. 
                        As my first project with Solidworks, I took the seven wonders of the world approach and twisted it to make a 
                        "World Clock."</p>

                    <h4>Bearing Housing Design</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of this project was to develop a bearing housing for a screw flute used for different applications. 
                        Since this project was completed during COVID, there was no access to Solidworks so a hand-drawn drawing was made 
                        instead.</p>
